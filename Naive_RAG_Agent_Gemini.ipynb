        "This notebook demonstrates how to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using Langchain, Google GenAI, and FAISS. The objective is to create an agent that can answer questions based on information retrieved from an external knowledge source, in this case, a blog post.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook covers the following steps:\n",
        "1. **Installation of necessary libraries**: Installing Langchain, langchain-text-splitters, langchain-community, bs4, and faiss-cpu.\n",
        "2. **Setting up Google Generative AI**: Importing and initializing the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` model and `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` for generating text and embeddings.\n",
        "3. **Creating a Vector Store with FAISS**: Setting up FAISS for efficient similarity search of document embeddings.\n",
        "4. **Loading and processing data**: Using `WebBaseLoader` to load content from a blog post and `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the document into smaller chunks.\n",
        "5. **Adding documents to the vector store**: Embedding the document chunks and adding them to the FAISS vector store.\n",
        "6. **Defining a retrieval tool**: Creating a Langchain tool to retrieve relevant document chunks based on a user query.\n",
        "7. **Creating an agent**: Building an agent using the initialized model and the retrieval tool.\n",
        "8. **Running the agent**: Executing the agent with a sample query to demonstrate its ability to retrieve information and formulate a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "The outcome of this notebook is a functional RAG agent that can use external knowledge to answer questions."
