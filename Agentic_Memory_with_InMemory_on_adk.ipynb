            "*   **Art Supplies:** Washable markers, chunky crayons, large sheets of paper, finger paints, or a Play-Doh set. An easel can also be a big hit!\n",
            "*   **Puzzles:** Age-appropriate puzzles (12-24 pieces), shape sorters, or chunky wooden puzzles help with problem-solving and spatial reasoning.\n",

              "   **1. Imaginative Play:**\n",
              "   *   **Play Kitchen or Food Set:** Kids love to \"cook\" and mimic adult activities. A sturdy play kitchen with pretend food, pots, and pans can provide hours of fun.\n",
              "   *   **Dress-Up Clothes:** Capes, crowns, animal costumes, or outfits for different professions (doctor, firefighter, chef) spark creativity and storytelling.\n",
              "   *   **Dollhouse or Action Figures/Animals:** Small world play helps them create their own narratives. Figures like farm animals, safari animals, or a simple dollhouse with chunky furniture are great.\n",
              "   *   **Doctor's Kit:** Perfect for role-playing and helps alleviate fears about doctor visits.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **2. Creative & Learning:**\n",
              "   *   **Building Blocks (Large Legos/Duplo, Magnetic Tiles):** Blocks like LEGO Duplo or magnetic building tiles (like Magna-Tiles or PicassoTiles) encourage creativity, problem-solving, and fine motor skills.\n",
              "   *   **Art Supplies:** Washable markers, chunky crayons, large sheets of paper, finger paints, or a Play-Doh set. An easel can also be a big hit!\n",
              "   *   **Puzzles:** Age-appropriate puzzles (12-24 pieces), shape sorters, or chunky wooden puzzles help with problem-solving and spatial reasoning.\n",
              "   *   **Books:** Beautiful picture books, lift-the-flap books, or interactive storybooks are always wonderful. Look for stories that spark imagination or teach about feelings and new concepts.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **3. Outdoor Fun & Gross Motor:**\n",
              "   *   **Balance Bike or Tricycle:** If she doesn't have one, a balance bike is excellent for developing coordination before moving to a pedal bike. A sturdy tricycle is also a classic choice.\n",
              "   *   **Scooter (3-Wheel):** A stable, three-wheel scooter can be great for developing balance and coordination.\n",
              "   *   **Bubble Machine:** Simple, inexpensive, and always a huge hit!\n",
              "   *   **Outdoor Sand/Water Table:** If she has a yard, a sand and water table provides endless sensory play opportunities.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **4. Board Games:**\n",
              "   *   **My First Board Games:** Look for simple games designed for preschoolers that focus on colors, counting, and taking turns (e.g., Candyland, Hi Ho Cherry-O, or Haba My First Games series).\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **Important Considerations:**\n",
              "   *   **Check with the parents!** They might have a wish list, specific items they need, or things they already have (or don't want more of).\n",
              "   *   **Prioritize open-ended toys:** Toys that can be played with in multiple ways often have a longer lifespan than single-function toys.\n",

              "*   **Dollhouse or Action Figures/Animals:** Small world play helps them create their own narratives. Figures like farm animals, safari animals, or a simple dollhouse with chunky furniture are great.\n",

              "*   **Building Blocks (Large Legos/Duplo, Magnetic Tiles):** Blocks like LEGO Duplo or magnetic building tiles (like Magna-Tiles or PicassoTiles) encourage creativity, problem-solving, and fine motor skills.\n",
              "*   **Art Supplies:** Washable markers, chunky crayons, large sheets of paper, finger paints, or a Play-Doh set. An easel can also be a big hit!\n",
              "*   **Puzzles:** Age-appropriate puzzles (12-24 pieces), shape sorters, or chunky wooden puzzles help with problem-solving and spatial reasoning.\n",
              "*   **Books:** Beautiful picture books, lift-the-flap books, or interactive storybooks are always wonderful. Look for stories that spark imagination or teach about feelings and new concepts.\n",

              "**3. Outdoor Fun & Gross Motor:**\n",

              "*   **Scooter (3-Wheel):** A stable, three-wheel scooter can be great for developing balance and coordination.\n",
              "*   **Bubble Machine:** Simple, inexpensive, and always a huge hit!\n",
              "*   **Outdoor Sand/Water Table:** If she has a yard, a sand and water table provides endless sensory play opportunities.\n",

              "1.  **Balance Bikes:**\n",
              "    *   **What they are:** These bikes have no pedals. Kids sit on the seat and propel themselves forward by pushing off the ground with their feet.\n",
              "    *   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:** Balance bikes are widely considered the *best* way to teach a child to ride a bike. They focus entirely on balance and steering, which are the most challenging aspects of riding. Children learn to glide with their feet up, and when they transition to a pedal bike later (often much earlier than kids who used training wheels), they already have the core skill of balancing mastered.\n",
              "    *   **Things to look for:**\n",
              "        *   **Adjustable Seat Height:** Make sure her feet can be flat on the ground with a slight bend in the knee when she's sitting.\n",
              "        *   **Lightweight:** Easier for her to maneuver and pick up if she falls.\n",
              "        *   **Footrest (optional):** Some models have a small platform for their feet once they're gliding.\n",
              "    *   **Age Appropriateness:** Perfect for 2-5 year olds. A 3-year-old is at an ideal age to start on a balance bike.\n",
              "\n",
              "2.  **Tricycles:**\n",
              "    *   **What they are:** Traditional three-wheeled bikes with pedals.\n",
              "    *   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:** Tricycles offer excellent stability, which can be comforting for younger children. They also introduce the concept of pedaling, though they don't teach balance in the same way a balance bike does. They are a classic option for getting around the driveway or park safely.\n",
              "    *   **Things to look for:**\n",
              "        *   **Sturdy Construction:** Make sure it's durable enough for energetic play.\n",

              "        *   **Push Handle (optional):** Some tricycles come with a parent handle on the back, which is great for guiding her or pushing when she gets tired.\n",

              "*   **Check Her Height/Inseam:** The most important factor for bike fit is ensuring her feet can reach the ground comfortably. For a balance bike, her feet should be flat on the ground. For a tricycle, her feet should comfortably reach the pedals.\n",
              "*   **Supervision:** Always ensure an adult is supervising when she's riding.\n",
              "\n",

              "\n",
              "**1. Imaginative Play:**\n",
              "*   **Play Kitchen or Food Set:** Kids love to \"cook\" and mimic adult activities. A sturdy play kitchen with pretend food, pots, and pans can provide hours of fun.\n",
              "*   **Dress-Up Clothes:** Capes, crowns, animal costumes, or outfits for different professions (doctor, firefighter, chef) spark creativity and storytelling.\n",
              "*   **Dollhouse or Action Figures/Animals:** Small world play helps them create their own narratives. Figures like farm animals, safari animals, or a simple dollhouse with chunky furniture are great.\n",
              "*   **Doctor's Kit:** Perfect for role-playing and helps alleviate fears about doctor visits.\n",
              "\n",
              "**2. Creative & Learning:**\n",
              "*   **Building Blocks (Large Legos/Duplo, Magnetic Tiles):** Blocks like LEGO Duplo or magnetic building tiles (like Magna-Tiles or PicassoTiles) encourage creativity, problem-solving, and fine motor skills.\n",
              "*   **Art Supplies:** Washable markers, chunky crayons, large sheets of paper, finger paints, or a Play-Doh set. An easel can also be a big hit!\n",
              "*   **Puzzles:** Age-appropriate puzzles (12-24 pieces), shape sorters, or chunky wooden puzzles help with problem-solving and spatial reasoning.\n",
              "*   **Books:** Beautiful picture books, lift-the-flap books, or interactive storybooks are always wonderful. Look for stories that spark imagination or teach about feelings and new concepts.\n",
              "\n",
              "**3. Outdoor Fun & Gross Motor:**\n",
              "*   **Balance Bike or Tricycle:** If she doesn't have one, a balance bike is excellent for developing coordination before moving to a pedal bike. A sturdy tricycle is also a classic choice.\n",
              "*   **Scooter (3-Wheel):** A stable, three-wheel scooter can be great for developing balance and coordination.\n",
              "*   **Bubble Machine:** Simple, inexpensive, and always a huge hit!\n",
              "*   **Outdoor Sand/Water Table:** If she has a yard, a sand and water table provides endless sensory play opportunities.\n",
              "\n",
              "**4. Board Games:**\n",
              "*   **My First Board Games:** Look for simple games designed for preschoolers that focus on colors, counting, and taking turns (e.g., Candyland, Hi Ho Cherry-O, or Haba My First Games series).\n",
              "\n",
              "**Important Considerations:**\n",
              "*   **Check with the parents!** They might have a wish list, specific items they need, or things they already have (or don't want more of).\n",
              "*   **Prioritize open-ended toys:** Toys that can be played with in multiple ways often have a longer lifespan than single-function toys.\n",
              "*   **Safety:** Ensure any toy is age-appropriate and free of small parts that could be a choking hazard.\n",

For a three-year-old, there are definitely age-appropriate options that are much safer and more effective than jumping straight to a two-wheeled pedal bike.\n",
              "\n",
              "Here are the best options for a three-year-old:\n",
              "\n",
              "1.  **Balance Bikes:**\n",
              "    *   **What they are:** These bikes have no pedals. Kids sit on the seat and propel themselves forward by pushing off the ground with their feet.\n",
              "    *   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:** Balance bikes are widely considered the *best* way to teach a child to ride a bike. They focus entirely on balance and steering, which are the most challenging aspects of riding. Children learn to glide with their feet up, and when they transition to a pedal bike later (often much earlier than kids who used training wheels), they already have the core skill of balancing mastered.\n",
              "    *   **Things to look for:**\n",
              "        *   **Adjustable Seat Height:** Make sure her feet can be flat on the ground with a slight bend in the knee when she's sitting.\n",
              "        *   **Lightweight:** Easier for her to maneuver and pick up if she falls.\n",
              "        *   **Footrest (optional):** Some models have a small platform for their feet once they're gliding.\n",
              "    *   **Age Appropriateness:** Perfect for 2-5 year olds. A 3-year-old is at an ideal age to start on a balance bike.\n",
              "\n",
              "2.  **Tricycles:**\n",
              "    *   **What they are:** Traditional three-wheeled bikes with pedals.\n",
              "    *   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:** Tricycles offer excellent stability, which can be comforting for younger children. They also introduce the concept of pedaling, though they don't teach balance in the same way a balance bike does. They are a classic option for getting around the driveway or park safely.\n",
              "    *   **Things to look for:**\n",
              "        *   **Sturdy Construction:** Make sure it's durable enough for energetic play.\n",
              "        *   **Comfortable Seat:** Important for longer rides.\n",
              "        *   **Push Handle (optional):** Some tricycles come with a parent handle on the back, which is great for guiding her or pushing when she gets tired.\n",
              "    *   **Age Appropriateness:** Generally suitable for 2-4 year olds.\n",
              "\n",
              "**Important Considerations for Any Ride-On Toy:**\n",
              "\n",
              "*   **Helmet!** This is non-negotiable. Always include a properly fitting helmet with any bike gift. It should sit low on the forehead, just above the eyebrows, and be snug.\n",
              "*   **Check Her Height/Inseam:** The most important factor for bike fit is ensuring her feet can reach the ground comfortably. For a balance bike, her feet should be flat on the ground. For a tricycle, her feet should comfortably reach the pedals.\n",
              "*   **Supervision:** Always ensure an adult is supervising when she's riding.\n",
              "\n",
              "**Which one to choose?**\n",
              "\n",
              "If the goal is to ultimately teach her to ride a two-wheeled bike independently, a **balance bike** is generally the superior choice as it teaches the fundamental skill of balance first. If you're looking for something that offers immediate stability and pedaling fun, a **tricycle** is a wonderful option. You might even consider asking her parents if they have a preference or if she's shown interest in one over the other!\"\"\"\n",
